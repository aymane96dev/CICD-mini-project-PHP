**CI/CD with PHP and GitHub Actions** üíª


This repository serves as a practical example for setting up a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline for a PHP project using **GitHub Actions**. It demonstrates how to automate code testing and deployment workflows.

**Project Setup** üõ†Ô∏è


**Prerequisites**

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** (version 8.1 or higher)

- **Composer** (for dependency management)

- A **web server** (e.g., Apache, Nginx) if you plan to run the application locally.


**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/aymane96dev/CICD-mini-project-PHP.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd CICD-mini-project-PHP.git`

3. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   `composer install`

**CI/CD Workflow** üöÄ


The CI/CD pipeline is configured in the `.github/workflows/` directory and consists of the following automated steps:


**Continuous Integration** (CI)

- **Trigger**: The workflow is triggered automatically on every `push` to the `main` branch and on `pull requests`.

- **Linting**: The code is checked for syntax errors and coding style standards.

- **Unit Tests**: PHPUnit tests are run to ensure the code's core logic functions as expected.

- **Dependency Audit**: Composer dependencies are checked for known security vulnerabilities.


**Continuous Deployment** (CD)

- **Trigger**: The deployment workflow is triggered upon a successful merge into the `main` branch.

- **Build**: A build artifact (e.g., a `.zip` file of the project) is created.

- **Deploy**: The application is automatically deployed to a production or staging environment (e.g., via **SSH**, **FTP**, or a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, etc.). Note: You will need to configure your own deployment credentials as GitHub Secrets.

**GitHub Actions Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

The core of the CI/CD pipeline is defined in YAML files within the `.github/workflows/` directory.

`ci.yml`: This file contains the workflow for Continuous Integration, including steps for linting, testing, and security checks.
